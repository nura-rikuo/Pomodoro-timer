# Pomodoro-timer
Quirky little pomodoro timer that runs on your terminal.
This is a pomodoro timer that runs in your terminal and so it is less distracting for you. Also you may ask why did I describe it as quirky. Well, to signal the start of a session
it plays you a small snippet of SICKO MODE and in order to signal the start of a break session, it plays you none other than Giorno's theme from Jojo :D. Hope you enjoy (◡ ω ◡)
